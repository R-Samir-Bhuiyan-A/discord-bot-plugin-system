# Self-Use Project Blueprint – Plugin-Based Core with Discord Bot + Web UI

This project is a **self-use plugin-driven system**.  
The **core system is built once** and must **never be modified again**.  
All features and extensions live in plugins.  
Persistent Markdown documentation ensures AI agents or future self can pick up work seamlessly.

---

## 1. Core Principles
- The core is permanent: never change after initial creation.  
- Core includes only:
  - Discord bot connection
  - Web UI with plugin store
  - Stable API layer exposing functionality to plugins
- All features, commands, and routes must live only in plugins.
- Core guarantees backward compatibility with all plugins.

---

## 2. Plugin System
- Plugins are the **only way** to extend functionality.  
- Plugins can:
  - Add Discord commands, events, or services
  - Add Web UI routes, pages, or APIs
- Plugins support:
  - Repo-based installation
  - Manual installation
- Plugins must be:
  - Self-contained
  - Readable
  - Fail-safe
  - Maintainable
- Real-time management:
  - Enable, disable, update, remove, configure
- Plugins can declare dependencies on other plugins

---

## 3. Plugin Manifest
Every plugin must include a `plugin.json` file. Example:

    {
      "name": "example-plugin",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "author": "Author Name",
      "description": "A sample plugin that adds a Discord command and a Web UI page.",
      "compatibility": {
        "core": ">=1.0.0"
      },
      "permissions": {
        "discord": ["commands", "events"],
        "web": ["routes", "pages"]
      },
      "dependencies": ["other-plugin-name"],
      "entry": "./index.js"
    }

---

## 4. Reliability & Fail-Safes
- Faulty plugins must never crash the system
- Errors must be logged and isolated
- Core continues running if plugins fail
- Centralized logging with configurable levels (Debug/Info/Warning/Error)
- Auto-reload updated plugins without restarting core
- Plugins run in sandboxed contexts to prevent memory leaks or infinite loops
- Scheduler/cron system for plugin tasks

---

## 5. Web UI Requirements
- Plugin store: browse, install, update, manage
- Manual plugin upload
- Plugin settings panel
- Real-time status dashboard
- Secure authentication & role-based access

---

## 6. Discord Bot Requirements
- Core provides Discord connection
- Expose APIs for plugins to:
  - Register commands
  - Subscribe to events
  - Add new services
- All features plugin-driven, no core logic

---

## 7. File Structure & Modularity
Highly modular and maintainable:

    project-root/
    ├── core/
    │   ├── discord/       # Base bot connection
    │   ├── web/           # Base Web UI + plugin store
    │   ├── api/           # Core API exposed to plugins
    │   ├── loader/        # Plugin loader and manager
    │   └── repo/          # Plugin repository manager
    ├── plugins/           # Installed plugins
    │   └── example-plugin/
    │       ├── plugin.json

    ├── tests/             # Automated tests
    ├── package.json
    └── README.md

---

## 8. Extensibility
- Allow new plugins without touching core
- Provide stable plugin API with hooks:
  - registerCommand
  - registerEvent
  - registerService
  - registerRoute
  - registerPage
- Auto dependency resolution
- Plugin template boilerplate for fast development

---

## 9. Documentation for AI Agent Handover
- All changes must create/update Markdown files in `docs/`
- Required docs:
  - roadmap.md
  - plugin-dev-guide.md
  - api-reference.md
  - change-log.md

---

## 10. Testing & Validation
- Automated tests for plugin load/unload, enable/disable/update/remove
- Core stability under faulty plugins
- Multi-plugin compatibility
- Web UI & Discord bot validation with multiple plugins active

---

## 11. Additional Self-Use Optimizations
- **Hot Module Reloading (HMR)**: update plugins without restarting core
- **Versioning & Backup**: automatic version control and backups for plugin configs
- **Scheduler / Cron system**: schedule tasks safely
- **Sandboxed Plugin Execution**: prevent plugin errors from crashing system
- **Plugin Dependencies**: auto-install or warn if missing
- **Notification/Event Bus**: plugins can safely subscribe to events
- **Analytics/Metrics**: track plugin usage and bot activity
- **Plugin Template Boilerplate**: standardized folder + manifest + example code

---

## 12. Roadmap

**Phase 1 – Core Setup**  
- Build permanent core (Discord + Web UI + API + loader)

**Phase 2 – Plugin Framework**  
- Define manifest format and hooks  
- Real-time enable/disable and sandboxing

**Phase 3 – Plugin Store**  
- Web UI for repo/manual install  
- Versioning & backup system
- Persistent plugin states across restarts
- Plugin deletion functionality

**Phase 4 – Reliability & Scheduler**  
- Logging, auto-reload, sandboxing  
- Cron/scheduler for plugin tasks

**Phase 5 – Developer Ecosystem**  
- Plugin dev guide, API reference, example plugins  
- Analytics, metrics, and templates

---

- Stable, never-changing core
- Modular, plugin-driven system powering all features
- Plugin store with repo + manual install
- Fail-safe reliability with hot-reloading and sandboxing
